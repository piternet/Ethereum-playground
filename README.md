# Ethereum-playground
Ethereum playground for simple Ethereum projects
Consists of (so far):
* __Simple voting app__, with hardcoded interface of a voting contract, which needs to be deployed by hand (using `node` console) and then the address in the code needs to be fixed - the simplest possible interaction from Javascript to the Ethereum contract
